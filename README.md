# Neural network multi-layer perceptron implementation in C++
I wanted to learn how neural networks work and thus implemented my own from scratch.

# Files
* `test.cpp` -- use NN to distinguish between unit *x* and *y* vectors
* `mnist.cpp` -- use NN to classify hand written digits. _NOTE_ you would need to get yourself a
copy of the MNIST dataset online.
